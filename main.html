			<p id="para"> Bike has always been a green and healthy way of getting around, also an alternative to avoid traffic congestion and delays. Currently, Pittsburgh bike sharing program - “Health Ride” provides a solution for citizens who are annoyed by commuting and traveling stress, but may facing the problem with load balancing especially during the rush hour. It was reported its riders took more than 10000 trips per month, which means it may become a new way for commuting and exercise. However, bike demands at different stations are various and unbalanced, user may run into an empty station to rent a bike or a full station to return a bike. By analyzing and visualizing bike sharing pattern, providing important supply and demand information in each station, program manager can rebalance bike supply in different stations to deal with the unbalance problem, and to improve the performance of the program. In addition, users may also use these information to adjust their travelling plans in advance. <br/><br/>
